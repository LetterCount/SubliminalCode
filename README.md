Hello, this is my first repository on Github, and I just want to thank [headlined](https://www.github.com/headlined) for inspiring me to code and start creating projects.

SubliminalCode is a web coding application that allows you to code and execute HTML, CSS, and Javascript (It will be like that when I upload the newest version.)

This was a creation made for the technology fair in my state (We go to state in April, we got 1st place in regionals)

After this final update I will push out soon, there will be no more commits to SubliminalCode.




ok bye
